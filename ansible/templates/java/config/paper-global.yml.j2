# This is the global configuration file for Paper.
# As you can see, there's a lot to configure. Some options may impact gameplay, so use
# with caution, and make sure you know what each option does before configuring.
#
# If you need help with the configuration or have any questions related to Paper,
# join us in our Discord or check the docs page.
#
# The world configuration options have been moved inside
# their respective world folder. The files are named paper-world.yml
